//! Core domain models for the flow trading system.
//!
//! This module contains the fundamental data structures that represent the domain entities.
//!
//! The models in this module are primarily data structures with minimal business logic,
//! following the principles of the hexagonal architecture to separate domain entities
//! from their persistence and processing implementations.
